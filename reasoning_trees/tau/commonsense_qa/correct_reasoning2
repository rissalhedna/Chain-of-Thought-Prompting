(natural habitat) stand out as the most relevant.
However, since the fox is moving from the city
into the forest, it is likely seeking its natural
habitat (C) rather than a hen house (B), which
implies a specific target rather than a general
environment." fillcolor=lightblue]

forest represents a natural habitat for the fox,

could be looking for food. However, option C is

B: hen house, since it aligns with the instinctual

plausible, option C (Natural habitat) describes a
broader and more natural instinct for the fox,
