on those efforts." fillcolor=lightblue]
	path3_step1 [label="Now, let's consider each option:" fillcolor=lightblue]
	path3_step2 [label="The most appropriate choice is \"ignore\" since it
directly implies that the sanctions do not
recognize or acknowledge the school's efforts to
improve." fillcolor=lightblue]

	path4_step0 [label="The question is about how the sanctions against
the school affected the school's efforts to
change. We need to find a word that reflects a
negative response to those efforts." fillcolor=lightblue]
	path4_step1 [label="Option A \"ignore\" suggests that the sanctions do
not recognize or acknowledge the efforts of the
school. Option B \"enforce\" implies reinforcing
rules or measures, which doesn't fit well. Option
C \"authoritarian\" describes a style of governance
but doesn't directly relate to the school's
efforts. Option D \"yell at\" is a figurative way of
saying to criticize, but it's not relevant here.
Option E \"avoid\" suggests steering clear of the
efforts, which isn't quite right either." fillcolor=lightblue]
	path4_step2 [label="After evaluating the meanings, \"ignore\" seems to
convey that the sanctions disregarded the school's
efforts, which aligns best with the context of the
