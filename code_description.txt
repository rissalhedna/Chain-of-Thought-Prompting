### Chain-of-Thought Prompting Methods

The core of this project involves evaluating four distinct CoT prompting methods, each employing unique strategies to guide the GPT-4 model's reasoning process. Below is a detailed examination of each method:

#### 1. Kojima

**Description**: The **Kojima** method is inspired by research initiatives aimed at enhancing language models' reasoning capabilities through minimalistic prompting strategies. This method emphasizes simplicity by embedding a prompt that encourages step-by-step reasoning without necessitating prior examples.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Prompt Structure**: Each question is prefixed with the phrase "Let's think step by step.", serving as a cue for the model to engage in structured reasoning.
- **Zero-Shot Prompting**: The method operates in a zero-shot setting, meaning that the model is not provided with any example-response pairs beforehand.

**Key Parameters**:
- `zero_shot`: A boolean flag indicating whether to use zero-shot prompting. When set to `True`, only the step-by-step prompt is added without demonstrations.

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Requires minimal modification to the original question, making it easy to implement across diverse datasets.
- **Encourages Structured Reasoning**: The embedded prompt fosters a logical decomposition of problems, potentially enhancing answer accuracy.

**Limitations**:
- **Lack of Demonstrations**: Absence of example reasoning paths may lead to variability and inconsistency in the model's reasoning process.
- **Dependence on Model's Internal Patterns**: Relies heavily on the model's inherent capability to interpret and act upon the provided prompt without additional guidance.

#### 2. Regular

**Description**: The **Regular** method serves as a baseline by providing straightforward prompts that instruct the model to deliver concise answers devoid of additional explanations or reasoning. This approach assesses the model's performance without the influence of structured reasoning cues.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Prompt Directive**: Each question is appended with explicit instructions such as "Do not provide any additional information. Just answer the question." to restrict the model's output to the final answer.

**Key Parameters**:
- **None**: Unlike other methods, Regular does not involve additional parameters but focuses solely on direct instructions appended to the question.

**Advantages**:
- **Conciseness**: Facilitates quick retrieval of answers without verbose explanations, making it efficient for scenarios requiring direct responses.
- **Baseline Performance**: Provides a reference point to evaluate the incremental benefits introduced by more sophisticated CoT methods.

**Limitations**:
- **Lack of Reasoning**: Without guiding the model through a reasoning process, the method does not leverage the model's capability to reason, potentially resulting in lower accuracy on complex or nuanced questions.
- **Potential for Guessing**: The absence of structured reasoning may lead the model to select answers based on surface-level patterns rather than deep comprehension.

#### 3. AutoCot

**Description**: The **AutoCot** method introduces automation into the generation of chain-of-thought demonstrations by leveraging clustering techniques. This approach aims to identify and select representative examples from the dataset, providing the model with contextual reasoning patterns tailored to the input question.

**Implementation Details**:
1. **Embedding Generation**:
    - **Technique**: Utilizes word embeddings to convert textual questions into numerical vectors capturing their semantic meanings.
    - **Embedding Model**: Employs a specialized embedding model (e.g., "text-embedding-3-small") to generate high-dimensional representations of questions.

2. **Clustering**:
    - **Algorithm**: Applies KMeans clustering to group semantically similar questions, aiming to identify distinct reasoning patterns within each cluster.
    - **Number of Clusters (`n_clusters`)**: Determined based on the dataset size (e.g., the square root of the number of samples divided by two) to balance computational efficiency and clustering granularity.

3. **Demonstration Selection**:
    - **Representative Points**: For each cluster, the question closest to the cluster center (as determined by Euclidean distance) is selected as the representative example.
    - **Purpose**: These selected questions serve as demonstrations to guide the model's reasoning process for similar questions within the cluster.

4. **Prompt Augmentation**:
    - **Integration**: Appends the selected demonstration examples to the current question, providing the model with contextually relevant reasoning patterns.
    - **Flexibility**: Adjusts the number of demonstrations based on the number of clusters, ensuring that the examples are both diverse and representative.

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_clusters`: Specifies the number of clusters for KMeans, influencing the diversity and representativeness of demonstrations.
- `embedding_model`: Defines the model used for generating word embeddings, impacting the quality and relevance of semantic representations.

**Advantages**:
