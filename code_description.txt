## Methodology

### Data Handling

The project utilizes a dedicated data handling module to load and preprocess datasets. The primary datasets under consideration are:

- **tau/commonsense_qa**: A dataset focused on evaluating common sense reasoning through multiple-choice questions.
- **openai/gsm8k**: A dataset designed to assess mathematical problem-solving abilities.

The data handling process involves loading the datasets using the Hugging Face library, converting them into manageable formats like Pandas DataFrames, and applying necessary preprocessing steps to structure the questions, choices, and answers appropriately. Additionally, the system supports sampling a subset of the data for evaluation purposes, ensuring flexibility in handling datasets of varying sizes.

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting Methods

The core of the project revolves around comparing four distinct CoT prompting methods. Each method employs a unique strategy to guide the model's reasoning process:

#### 1. Kojima

**Description**: The Kojima method is inspired by research focusing on enhancing language models' reasoning capabilities. This approach integrates prompts that encourage the model to engage in step-by-step reasoning without requiring prior examples.

**Implementation**: This method prepends the phrase "Let's think step by step." to each question. By doing so, it nudges the model to decompose the problem and provide a structured reasoning process leading to the final answer.

**Advantages**:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement with minimal adjustments to the original question.
- **Encourages Structured Reasoning**: Guides the model to logically work through problems, potentially improving answer accuracy.

**Limitations**:
- **Lack of Demonstrations**: Without example reasoning paths, the model's step-by-step process might vary, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Dependence on Model's Internal Patterns**: Relies heavily on the model's inherent ability to follow the prompt and reason step-by-step.

#### 2. Regular

**Description**: The Regular method serves as a baseline by providing straightforward prompts that instruct the model to deliver concise answers without additional explanations or reasoning.

**Implementation**: This approach appends instructions such as "Do not provide any additional information. Just answer the question." to each question. The goal is to elicit direct answers, maintaining brevity and focus.

**Advantages**:
- **Conciseness**: Retrieves answers quickly without verbose explanations.
- **Baseline Performance**: Offers a reference point to assess the effectiveness of more sophisticated CoT methods.

**Limitations**:
- **Lack of Reasoning**: Does not leverage the model's capability to reason, which might result in lower accuracy on complex or nuanced questions.
- **Potential for Guessing**: Without guided reasoning, the model might select answers based on surface-level patterns rather than deep comprehension.

#### 3. AutoCot

**Description**: The AutoCot method automates the generation of chain-of-thought demonstrations by leveraging clustering techniques to identify and select representative examples from the dataset.

**Implementation**: This approach involves several steps:
1. **Embedding Generation**: Converts questions into numerical vectors capturing their semantic meanings.
2. **Clustering**: Applies KMeans clustering to group similar questions, identifying clusters that represent distinct reasoning patterns.
3. **Demonstration Selection**: Selects the most representative question from each cluster to serve as demonstration examples.
4. **Prompt Augmentation**: Appends these selected examples to the current question, providing the model with contextual reasoning prompts.

**Advantages**:
- **Contextual Demonstrations**: Provides relevant reasoning examples tailored to the input question, potentially enhancing reasoning accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Automatically generates demonstrations without manual intervention, suitable for large datasets.
- **Semantic Relevance**: Ensures that demonstrations are contextually similar to the questions being evaluated through effective clustering.

**Limitations**:
- **Dependency on Embedding Quality**: The effectiveness hinges on the quality of the generated embeddings and the clustering algorithm's performance.
- **Computational Overhead**: Clustering and embedding generation can be resource-intensive, especially with large datasets.
- **Potential Redundancy**: If clusters are not well-defined, selected demonstrations might be repetitive or not adequately representative.

#### 4. TreeReasoning

**Description**: The TreeReasoning method adopts a hierarchical reasoning approach by generating multiple reasoning paths with varying degrees of creativity, constructing a reasoning tree, and employing majority voting to determine the final answer.

**Implementation**: This method encompasses several key components:
1. **Structured Prompting**: Formats the prompt to outline a four-step reasoning process, ensuring consistency in the model's responses.
2. **Diverse Reasoning Paths**: Varies the temperature parameter during model calls to generate responses ranging from conservative to creative.
3. **Reasoning Tree Construction**: Builds a directed graph representing different reasoning chains, facilitating visualization and analysis.
4. **Majority Voting**: Aggregates answers from different reasoning paths to determine the most common and presumably correct answer.
5. **Visualization**: Utilizes Graphviz to create visual representations of the reasoning trees, enhancing interpretability and providing insights into the reasoning processes.

**Advantages**:
- **Diverse Reasoning**: Captures a range of perspectives by generating multiple reasoning paths, potentially mitigating individual path biases.
- **Aggregated Decision-Making**: Majority voting leverages collective reasoning, enhancing accuracy and reliability.
- **Visual Insights**: Reasoning trees offer a clear overview of how different reasoning paths converge or diverge, aiding in debugging and analysis.
- **Robustness**: Balances creativity and consistency by considering multiple temperature settings, ensuring comprehensive reasoning outcomes.

**Limitations**:
- **Graphviz Dependency**: Requires Graphviz to be installed and properly configured, which can pose setup challenges.
- **Computational Overhead**: Multiple model calls for each question increase computational resources and time.
- **Potential Overcomplexity**: Managing and interpreting multiple reasoning paths can become cumbersome, especially with larger datasets.
